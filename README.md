In the repository, we propose a simple algorithm termed *ReSeFa* to precisely control the local region of an image generated by GANs.
Namely, we re-examine the task of local editing with pre-trained GAN models and formulate region-based semantic discovery as a dual optimization problem. 
By an appropriately defined generalized Rayleigh quotient, we solve such a problem in a closed-form way, avoiding any annotations or training on the models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.
